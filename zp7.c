// ZP7: branchless PEXT/PDEP replacement code for non-Intel processors
//
// The PEXT/PDEP instructions are pretty cool, with various (usually arcane)
// uses, behaving like bitwise gather/scatter instructions. They were introduced
// by Intel with the BMI2 instructions on Haswell.
//
// AMD processors implement these instructions, but very slowly. PEXT/PDEP can
// take from 18 to ~300 cycles, depending on the input mask. See this table:
// https://mobile.twitter.com/InstLatX64/status/1209095219087585281
// Other processors don't have PEXT/PDEP at all. This code is a polyfill for
// these processors. It's much slower than the raw instructions on Intel chips
// (which are 3L1T), but should be faster than AMD's implementation.
//
// Description of the algorithm
// ====
//
// This code uses a "parallel prefix popcount" technique (hereafter PPP for
// brevity). What this means is that we determine, for every bit in the input
// mask, how many bits below it are set. Or rather, aren't set--we need to get
// a count of how many bits each input bit should be shifted to get to its final
// position, that is, the difference between the bit-index of its destination
// and its original bit-index. This is the same as the count of unset bits in
// the mask below each input bit.
//
// The dumb way to get this PPP would be to create a 64-element array in a loop,
// but we want to do this in a bit-parallel fashion. So we store the counts
// "vertically" across six 64-bit values: one 64-bit value holds bit 0 of each
// of the 64 counts, another holds bit 1, etc. We can compute these counts
// fairly easily using a parallel prefix XOR (XOR is equivalent to a 1-bit
// adder that wraps around and ignores carrying). Using parallel prefix XOR as
// a 1-bit adder, we can build an n-bit adder by shifting the result left by
// one and ANDing with the input bits: this computes the carry by seeing where
// an input bit causes the 1-bit sum to overflow from 1 to 0. The shift left
// is needed anyways, because we want the PPP values to represent population
// counts *below* each bit, not including the bit itself.
//
// For processors with the CLMUL instructions (most x86 CPUs since ~2010), we
// can do the parallel prefix XOR and left shift in one instruction, by
// doing a carry-less multiply by -2. This is enabled with the HAS_CLMUL define.
//
// Anyways, once we have these six 64-bit values of the PPP, we can use each
// PPP bit to shift input bits by a power of two. That is, input bits that are
// in the bit-0 PPP mask are shifted by 2**0==1, bits in the bit-1 mask get
// shifted by 2, and so on, for shifts by 4, 8, 16, and 32 bits. Out of these
// six shifts, any shift value between 0 and 63 can be composed.
//
// For PEXT, we have to perform each shift in increasing order (1, 2, ...32) so
// that input bits don't overlap in the intermediate results. PDEP is the
// opposite: the 32-bit shift needs to happen first to make room for the smaller
// shifts. There's also a small complication for PDEP in that the PPP values
// line up where the input bits *end*, rather than where the input bits start
// like for PEXT. This means each bit mask needs to be shifted backwards before
// ANDing with the input bits.
//
// For both PEXT/PDEP the input bits need to be pre-masked so that only the
// relevant bits are being shifted around. For PEXT, this is a simple AND
// (input &= mask), but for PDEP we have to mask out everything but the low N
// bits, where N is the population count of the mask.
